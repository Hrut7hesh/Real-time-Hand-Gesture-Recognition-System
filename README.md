# Sign Language Detection using MediaPipe and OpenCV
This project implements real-time hand sign detection using MediaPipe and OpenCV. It detects various hand signs such as B, D, F, G, H, I, LIKE, and DISLIKE based on the hand gestures captured by a webcam.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install the following dependencies:
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
You can install these dependencies using pip:
```
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
```
## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
https://github.com/Hrut7hesh/Sign-Language-Detection.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd Sign-Language-Detection
```
3. Run the Python script:
```
python hand_sign_detection.py
```
This will open a window showing the webcam feed with hand sign detection overlay.
